### (c) Finally...    (for now!)

Create yet another project, Lab04c, and try the following:

1.  Can you predict what the following code will print out?

    double d;
    d = 0.1;
    while ( d != 1.0 )
    {
       System.out.println( d);
       d = d + 0.1;
    }
    System.out.println( d + " <- final value after loop!");

    Copy-paste it into your IDE and run it to check your prediction.

    Modify the condition such that it uses less-than instead of not-equal. What will happen if you run it now?

    Can you explain why this happens? What is the moral of the story?
